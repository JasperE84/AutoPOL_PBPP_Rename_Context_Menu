# AutoPOL_PBPP_Rename_Context_Menu

In order for this to work with SAFAN machinery, the filenames inside the PBPP (which is a ZIP file) need to be renamed accordingly.

Steps to install
1. Compile and copy files in bin/Releaes to for instance C:\MyTools (Or another folder where the files will stay)
2. Start ServerManager.exe from the SharpShell Tools (https://github.com/dwmkerr/sharpshell)
3. File->Load Server
4. Selecteer c:\MyTools\ContourShellExtension.dll
5. Select added DLL in list and choose Server->Install
6. PBPP files in explorer now have a richt click context menu button "SAFAN PBPP Rename"
